        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>One of my earliest memories is playing with markers in my mom's art room. Since I was little, I've been surrounded with art. Both my parents being in the art world, Growing up, I knew I wanted to continue my passion. However, I was concerned with making enough and what exactly I wanted to do. In my junior year of high school, I enrolled in the UM Summer Scholars Program for architecture, and immediately fell in love. It felt like the perfect mix of art and math and I loved the problem-solving.</p>
