        <h1>Hello there, my name's Nefele!</h1>

        <p>I'm a fourth year architecture student studying at the University of Miami. This is my first time coding!</p>

        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>One of my earliest memories is playing with crayons and markers in my mom's study. Growing up, I always knew I wanted to pursue a career in the art world, but I wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to do. In my junior year of high school, I enrolled in the UM Summer Scholars Program for architecture and immediately fell in love. I loved the problem-solving aspect to it, and how I could incorporate my art background in the concept drawings and renderings I created. I'm in my fourth year of architecture school now and I hope that once I graduate, I can become a fully licensed architect and one day start my own architecture firm.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <h3>Art</h3>

        <p>Art has surrounded me my entire life. Born and raised in Miami, our first house shared a lake with our neighborhood block, and I would spend my days documenting and sketching all the tadpoles, lizards, turtles and other animals that wound up by the lake. I was always looking for ways to experiment with different kinds of art but I was never big on painting with traditional oils or watercolor. In highschool, I focused on ceramics and wire sculpture. Later on, when COVID hit, I started exploring textile art, and rug tufting. Some of my favorite artists include: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>James Turrell</li>
            <li>Yayoi Kusama</li>
            <li>Yoshitomo Nara</li>
            <li>Kehinde Wiley</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cars</h3>

        <p>A recent hobby of mine within the past couple of years has been cars. I own a Mazda MX-5 Miata (I call her Yogi because the color of my car reminds me of yogurt) and I take her to car meets and drives on the weekends. Mazdas of South Florida is a group that I've joined recently, which hosts monthly drives down to the Keys. My brother and I also love to go to the Cars and Coffee meets in Miami and Ft Lauderdale. All of the work done to my car I've done myself. That includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Oil change</li>
            <li>Brake pad replacement</li>
            <li>Suspension sway bar upgrade</li>
            <li>Coilover replacement</li>
            <li>Wheel replacement</li>
        </ul>

        <pi>While my car is obviously my favorite, there are still some cars I'd love to own or drive one day. Here are my favorites and some descriptions:</pi>

        <dl>
            <dt>Chevrolet Corvette Z06:</dt>
            <dd>505-<abbr title="Horsepower">hp</abbr></dd>
            <dd>A powerful car that's responsive and easy to work on. The engine has more power paired with wider tires and better brakes compared to the regular Corvette. Even though the interior is supposed to be cheap, the outside looks great and many say the car feels connected to the driver.</dd>

            <dt>Porsche 964</dt>
            <dd>250-<abbr title="Horsepower">hp</abbr></dd>
            <dd>A light car that's the first of it's kind to have all-wheel drive. The 964 has the iconic bug-eye headlights and a classic look to it that makes it so popular.</dd>

            <dt>Subaru WRX STI</dt>
            <dd>350-<abbr title="Horsepower">hp</abbr></dd>
            <dd>All-wheel drive car that really handles well and has superb traction. A friend of mine owned this car and it was one of the easiest cars to drive and pretty reliable.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Music</h3>

        <p>I listen to alot of different music. When I was young, my parents mostly played 80's hits. As I got older, I started to listen to rap and rock. Now, I've been getting into house music, as Miami has an extensive house music scene. Here's an outline of some of my favorite rock bands:</p>
