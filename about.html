          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm Nefele Talavera, a fourth-year architecture student from Miami, studying at the University of Miami. From a young age, I have always been immersed in and passionate about making art. In my third year of high school, I participated in the University of Miami's Summer Scholars program for architecture, and it was there that I fell in love with the field. The nature of problem-solving in architecture and the integration of art in design inspired me to pursue my studies at the University of Miami.</p>
          <p>This year, I have been exploring web design and computer science classes, as well as the intersection of architecture with Virtual Reality. Currently, I serve as a 3D Modeler at the University's XR Lab, where I am contributing to the creation of a digital twin of the University's campus, which was utilized for the incoming freshman orientation.</p>
