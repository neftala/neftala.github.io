          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm Nefele Talavera, a fourth year architecture student from Miami studying at the University of Miami. From a young age, I was always immersed in and making art. In my third year of high-school, I particpated in the University of Miami's Summer Scholars program for architecture, and it was here that I fell in love with architecture. The nature of problem-solving in architecture, and the presence of art in design is what set me to begin studying it at the University of Miami.
          </p>
          <p>This year, I've been exploring web design and computer science classes, as well as the convergence of architecture with Virtual Reality. Currently occupying the role as 3D Modeler at the University's XR Lab, I am engaged in crafting a digital twin of the University's campus which was used for the incoming freshman orientation.</p>
