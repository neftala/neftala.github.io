      <p>I'm Nefele talavera, a fourth year architecture student studying at the university of Miami. My passion for architecture started from a young age, when my family and I would visit family in Greece. I always found myself poking around at the ancient ruins nearby our town, and spent days at the history museum within the town's center.
 
      This year, I've been exploring web design and computer science classes, as well as the convergence of architecture with Virtual Reality. Currently occupying the role as 3D Modeler at the University's XR Lab, I am engaged in crafting a digital twin of the university's campus which was used for the incoming freshman orientation.</p>
